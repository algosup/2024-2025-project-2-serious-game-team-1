|Origin|Description|Severity|bug correction|
|-|-|-|-|
|Beach Quest|During or after the quest, if the player talks to the NPC Roger again, they can restart the quest at will. However, it's impossible to complete it a second time, as the bottles already collected cannot be retrieved again.The dialogue with Roger needs to change during and after the quest. |Medium||
|Beach Quest |It’s hard to know where to go during the quest, particularly when the bottles need to be thrown into the factory's trash bin. A guide indicator would be useful to direct the player to the correct location.|Low||
|Beach Quest|The quest lacks an indicator clearly marking its end. Additionally, once the quest is completed, the reward data, meant to be obtained as a completion prize, is not saved in the documentary.|Major||
|Beach Quest|The player can pick up the bottles before starting the quest. However, if the player then speaks to Roger to begin the quest, the bottles they already collected (and thus disappeared) aren’t counted, making the quest impossible to finish.|Major||
|Dialogue|When a player opens their inventory during a dialogue with an NPC and then closes it immediately, it becomes possible to move while still continuing the conversation, causing abnormal behavior.|Medium||
|Dialogue Elie|When a player talks to the NPC Elie and clicks to accept a quest, the game crashes immediately.|Medium||
|Menu Setting|After opening the menu with "Esc" in-game and going to the Settings, it's impossible to go back. Pressing the "Go Back" button causes the game to crash. However, this bug doesn't happen when going through the game's title screen.|Major||
|Menu|After opening the game and choosing to return to the title screen, it's impossible to start a new game. When clicking the "Play" button again, the game doesn’t launch. |Medium||
|Collision|If the player gets too close to a 3D model in the environment, they can see through it. Either the camera is too advanced, or the player's collision needs to be adjusted.|Medium||
|Collision|The player can easily get stuck in the environment when attempting to climb objects, which can disrupt the gaming experience.|Medium||
|Farm|Upon entering the farm area, the player can hear the sound of a chicken. However, no chickens are visible, creating a sound environment inconsistency|Low||
