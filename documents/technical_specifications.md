# Convention 


Our project needs to respect several conditions, functionalities and conventions : 

## Github

- We must use Github to manage our project.


## Github Guidelines

### 1. Branch 

- Each branch should be named in English and given a clear, descriptive name to represent its purpose.
Branches are used to isolate work on a specific feature, bug fix, or task without affecting the main codebase.

- By using branches, developers can experiment, make changes, and test code independently before integrating it with the main branch.

- Branch names should be concise but informative, ideally indicating the specific feature, issue, or task they address.

### 2. Commit 

- Each commit should be named in English and carry a descriptive title to clarify its purpose.
- Frequent commits are encouraged to provide a detailed record of all changes.
- Work-in-progress (WIP) code can be committed, provided it is not merged into the main branch.
Multiple commits within a single branch are acceptable to document progressive updates.

### 3. Pull Request 

- Pull requests must have a clear, descriptive title in English, accurately reflecting the changes.
- A pull request requires approval from at least one other team member before merging.
- The author or a designated project maintainer should be responsible for merging the pull request.
- A detailed summary of the changes made should accompany each pull request for reference.

### 4. Issue 

- Each issue should have an informative and specific title in English.
- Issues should be assigned to a responsible team member for resolution.
- Include a clear, concise description of the issue to outline the problem (see [Issues](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-2-serious-game-team-1/issues)).


## Naming

<br>

It is important to establish a naming convention for projects. This makes the source code easier to read and understand with less effort. There are many naming conventions :

<br>

- It has been decided to use the following convention nammings for this project : 



| Naming Context | Naming Convention |
|----------------|-------------------|
| InputMap       | `flatcase`         |
| Autoload       | `PascalCase`        |
| function       | `camel_Snake_case`  |
| variable       | `kebab-case`        |
| groups         | `camelCase`         |
| folder         | `Train-Case`        |

## About Godot Engine 

<br>

Godot Engine is a free, open-source game engine for creating 2D and 3D games. 
It offers comprehensive tools to facilitate development, and can be easily exported to multiple platforms (computers, mobiles, web, consoles). 

Entirely licensed by MIT, it gives developers a great deal of freedom and control over their creations. 
A library of asserts is also included in the software.

### Node

A Node is the basic unit in Godot. It's an entity that has a set of properties and specific functionalities, like displaying an image, playing a sound, or handling a collision area. There are different types of nodes, each with distinct roles:

- Node2D and Node3D for 2D and 3D objects,
- Sprite to display an image,
- Area2D to handle collision detection areas,
- AudioStreamPlayer to play sound, etc.

Nodes can be organized in a hierarchical structure as children of other nodes, creating a tree structure. This parent-child system allows child nodes to "inherit" certain behaviors from their parents, like position in space or visibility.

## Scene

A Scene is a group of nodes organized to create a functional game element, such as a character, a user interface, or a complete level. A scene can contain multiple nodes, arranged in a hierarchy to form a logical structure. The advantage of this system is that each scene can be reused, combined with others, or instantiated multiple times to create repetitive or modular elements in the game.

For example, you can create:

- a scene for a level,
- a scene for a player character (with nodes for the sprite, animations, collisions, etc.),
- a scene for the user interface (UI).
Each scene can be saved as a file and imported into other scenes. This system makes development modular and allows you to work on individual elements of the game without affecting the entire project.


## About Game 

### Perspective

Godot Engine can create both 2D and 3D games. This flexibility is one of its standout features, as it allows developers to use a single tool to create a wide range of game experiences, from pixel art platformers to immersive 3D worlds.

In our case, we decided to use 3D, thinking that it was better suited to our game and ambiation.

## User Interface

#### Main Menu

A menu will be available, accessible by pressing the `esc` "escape" key. It will allow you to access all the settings (audio, graphics, keys, etc.), or quit the game.

#### Inventory

An inventory will keep track of all the player's items and allow them to navigate between the items in their bag by pressing the `e` key . A drag-and-drop system will be used to create this system.

#### HUD

From the main game screen, players can access a range of information : 

- Maps : a mini-map will be displayed in the top right-hand corner of the screen to help players find their way around.
- Time : the time will be displayed below the mini-map, allowing the player to keep track of the time.
- Control : the control description will be placed at the bottom left of the screen, giving players quick access to the buttons they can use.
- Reputation : A progress bar showing the reputation of the location the player is in will be placed at the top left.
- Quests : A list of quests will be placed below the player to inform them of the actions to be carried out.


### Mechanics

The following mechanics will be included in the game:

#### Movement

The player will be able to move in four directions (Up, Down, Left, Right) using the following key mappings:

| Key | Direction |
| --- | --------- |
| `Z`   | Forward   |
| `S`   | Backward  |
| `Q`   | Left      |
| `D`   | Right     |

#### Inspection 

The player can inspect the objects. They can rotate the objects in four directions (up, down, left, right) using the following key combinations:
| Key | Direction      |
| --- | ---------------|
| `Z`   | Rotation Up    |
| `S`   | Rotation Down  |
| `Q`   | Rotation Left  |
| `D`   | Rotation Right |

This action temporarily disables the player's movement for as long as the inspection function is in use.

#### Teleportation

The player can teleport around the island. This action will change the player's position  using the following key :
| Key | Action    |
| --- | ----------|
| XXXXX | Teleportation |


The teleport action temporarily disables the player's movement for as long as this function is used.


#### Vehicules

The player can enter and drive a vehicle. Once inside, they can move the vehicle in four directions using the following key combinations:

| Key | Action            |
| --- | ------------------ |
| `Z`   | Move Forward      |
| `S`   | Move Backward     |
| `Q`   | Turn Left         |
| `D`   | Turn Right        |
| `F`   | Enter/Exit Vehicle |

When inside the vehicle, the player's standard movement controls are disabled until they exit the vehicle using the **F** key.

- Support for cross-language scripting.

- Many 2D, 3D and 4D linear algebra data types such as vectors and transforms.

## GDScript:

- High-level interpreted language with optional static typing.

- Syntax inspired by Python. However, GDScript is not based on Python.

- Syntax highlighting is provided on GitHub.

- Use threads to perform asynchronous actions or make use of multiple processor cores.

Example : 

```txt
func _ready():

	print("Hello world!")

```

### Methods

In GDScript, methods are functions that belong to a class. They are used to define actions that an object can perform. Methods can be used to manipulate data, interact with other objects, or perform calculations.

Example :

`func my_method():
    var my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    var array_length = len(my_array)
    print("Length of the array: ", array_length)  # Display "5"`
