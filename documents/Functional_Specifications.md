## II. Project Overview

### A. Purpose

The project was commissioned by ALGOSUP to create a "Serious Game" on the theme of global warming. The aim is to talk about the causes and solutions for combating this current phenomenon, which is having an ever-increasing impact on us.

### B. What is a Serious Game

A serious game (video game or board game) is the lovely match between serious, educational content and video game's mechanics and storytelling. It's a tool incredibly efficient at communicating educational messages in an interactive, engaging and federating way.

The term of "serious game" is used since the beginning of the twentieth century, and the best-known game is The Landlord's Game (predecessor of Monopoly) in 1903.

In the early 1990s, a number of games on this theme were released, followed by another spike to over 100 games a year and a third in 2007 with over 200 games.
These spikes are due to a growing awareness of the climate emergency, and there are no fewer than 2,000 different games on the subject.

Serious games are commonly used to educate, raise awareness and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as for therapeutic purposes.

The quests that you can complete on this place are:

- collecting rubbish
- restoring coral reefs
- protecting marine wildlife

### C. Optional features

Here are all optional features that we can find in the game after the prototype phase:

- teleportation between two spaces
- add biomes (forest, fields, mountain)
- add quests (until 10 per biomes)
- the main house of the player (in the city)
- the story
- add bike to move on the map

##### b. Time developement

We have 61 hours and 45 minutes dedicated to develop the game.
This amount of time don't take in consideration any overtime that members can do during the project.

#### 2. Environment

- Visual Studio Code on documents
- Godot on development
- MacOS and Windows on development

#### 3. Security

- respect RGPD and data saving law

## V. Risk

### A. Competitors



### B. Product problem

One of the big problems to consider with this mirror is the increase in people's paranoia about illness and the growing number of people suffering from hypochondria.

### C. Data

If we want to have a connected mirror with smartphone, we need to interest us on the **the reglementation of data backups**.
There are three different archives depending on the type of data :
- **Active database archiving** where data that are no longer useful to the enterprise (for example, data on job seekers to which they have not followed up) are deleted once the reason for the study has been completed (after a maximum of two years).
- **Intermediate archiving** where data are saved even after the purpose of data collection has been achieved as they are still of interest to the enterprise. The duration is set by the person responsible and must be relevant to its usefulness.
- **Final archiving** where data that remains of great interest in the future without an end date are saved, after an upstream check.
