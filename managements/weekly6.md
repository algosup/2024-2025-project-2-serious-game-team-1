| **Guillaume Despaux**|Still on the map, the lack of finding good assets is hard (not bugged, of free)| More "pressure" on the devs to let them focus more on the essential. Give us more infos about tasks already set up. | Just little bit tired but nothing alarming. | The devs are talking maybe a little too much and maybe work as 2 for 1 they're looking each other code all the time and this is lose time I presume.         | 0                  | 0                   |
