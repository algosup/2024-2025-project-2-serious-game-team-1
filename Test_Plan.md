## Scope of Testing
This test plan was designed to test the game *The Renewable Island*.
Testing will focus on ensuring the game's functionality,primarily focusing on 
## Risk Analysis
A widely recognized challenge in the field of testing is that it is impossible to test everything exhaustively.

The principles defined by ISTQB2, developed over the years alongside the evolution of testing practices and software development, are now considered the essential foundations of the profession.

Taking into account the previous information, as well as the fact that this is the first version of the game, here are the most important features to test:
|feature|why|
|-|-|
|Control|Players need to be able to move around easily in the open world|
|interactions with objects|Players must be able to interact with objects and use it|
|inventory|Facilitates interaction between the player and the environment|
|Quest|Quests need to be functional for a better user experience|

## Scheduling and Test Approach
During this phase, the testing will be on the mechanics and dynamics of the game to ensure that the game is coherent. 
the test period will be divided into two parts:
- Technical validation phase
- User experience phase

### Technical validation phase
