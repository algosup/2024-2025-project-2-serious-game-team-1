Documentation_explanation = "Today, we find more and more products with packaging made from recycled products. Even so, the recycling rate for household plastics is only 21%. And yet, the manufacture of plastic from recycled plastic emits 88% fewer GHGs than the production of plastic from primary materials. So it's vital to recycle this waste."
