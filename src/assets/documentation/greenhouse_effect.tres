Documentation_name = "Greenhouse effect"
Documentation_explanation = "Climate change is caused principally by the greenhouse effect.
The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon that enables the Earth to maintain a temperature conducive to life. Without it, our planet's average surface temperature would be around -18°C, almost 30°C cooler than it is now, at +15°C.
Its principle is : 
The Sun sends out rays of light (energy in luminous form). Some of this energy is absorbed, while some is reflected into space through infrared radiation.
Greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere capture some of this infrared radiation, preventing it from escaping completely into space. This warms the air and stabilizes the planet's climate.
We have different greenhouse gases: water vapor (H₂O), Carbon dioxide (CO₂), Methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and Ozone (which protects the Earth from harmful UV rays).
And different \"industrial\" greenhouse gases: Fluorinated gases, which come from the cooling systems in our refrigerators or are used as solvents, Sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), used in transformers and double-glazing (sound insulation), Nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃), often used as an industrial degreaser in the manufacture of LCD screens and photovoltaic cells."
