Documentation_name = "Forest Fires"
Documentation_explanation = "Forest fires have three main causes, their are:
- Cigarette butts: poorly extinguished cigarettes cause almost 800 forest fires every year.
- Burning rubbish: whether dead leaves, dry branches, or debris can escape and ignite the surrounding vegetation, as happens more than 3,000 times a year.
- Campfires: they cause more than 11,000 forest fires a year because people don't know how to contain their campfires and extinguish them properly.
Fires were responsible for 15% of GHG emissions last year, and this figure is not expected to fall.
