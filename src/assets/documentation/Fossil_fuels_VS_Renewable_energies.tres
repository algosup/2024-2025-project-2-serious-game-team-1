Documentation_name = "Fossil fuels VS Renewable energies"
Documentation_explanation = "Fossil fuels account for 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to rising temperatures and severe ecological harm, such as ocean acidification and biodiversity loss. Conversely, renewables like solar and wind emit 70–90% less CO₂ over their lifecycle. By 2050, transitioning to renewables could reduce land-use impacts by 30% compared to fossil fuels and avoid up to four times more species extinctions. Despite requiring resources for infrastructure, renewables are crucial to limiting global warming to 1.5°C​"
